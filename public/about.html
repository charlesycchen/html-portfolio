<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A new BS graduate majored in Physics and minored in Computer Science and Engineering at the National Chung Hsing University.</p>

<p>With the training in physics, always use first principle thinking to get feasible solutions by finding the root causes. 
  Able to express opinions clearly to people from different fields and organize positive ideas to reach a consensus, and
